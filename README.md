# Here is the code for RCareWorld PhyRC Challenge ðŸ¦¾
This codebase requires a minimal installation of RCareWorld. You will have access to executables without the scenes for the competition. We will release the simulation environments for the robot-assisted dressing and bed bathing before Aug 8th AOE.

This repo is currently in the testing stage.

# Hardware requirements
While RCareWorld supports Linux, Windows, and Mac (experimental), our evaluation platform is based on Ubuntu 20.04. We do not guarantee the simulation environments for the competition work on MacOS, Windows, or other Linux versions as intended. The executable files are by default for Linux systems. If you want to use Windows or Mac (not recommended), download it from [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TW-C6k1z5xCdgE7q1ht3Flb2FaeCrQ51?usp=sharing) and update the executable_file path.

We highly recommend using an Ubuntu 20.04 system which will be used for evaluation. Please make sure your computer has at least 10GB of free space before starting.

# Download Guide
<!-- - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld.git`
- Switch to the `phy-robo-care` branch: `cd RCareWorld` and then `git checkout phy-robo-care ` -->
Clone the `phy-robo-care` branch of the repo: `git clone -b phy-robo-care https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld.git`

# Install Guide
First of all, please ensure that conda is installed on your computer.
For details, refer to the conda installation guide: [Conda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

<!-- - Create a conda environment with Python 3.10: `conda create -n rcareworld python=3.10`
- Activate the conda environment: `conda activate rcareworld`
- Install the requirements: `cd pyrcareworld` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install pyrcareworld: `pip install -e .`
- Verify the installation works: `cd pyrcareworld/demo/examples` and run `python test_scene.py`. You should expect to see the RCareWorld Unity executable window pop up with a white cube. -->

```
# Create a conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n rcareworld python=3.10

# Activate the conda environment 
conda activate rcareworld

# Install the requirements
cd pyrcareworld
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Verify the installation works
cd pyrcareworld/demo/examples
python test_scene.py

```

# Get Started with the Examples
Check the examples in `pyrcareworld/pyrcareworld/demo/examples` folder. 

# Starter Scripts for Bathing and Dressing Tasks
Check the `test_bathing.py` and `test_dressing.py` to get an overall idea about how to use the simulation environments. Your score will be 
stored in a json file called `spongeScore.json` for bathing and `dressingScore.json` for dressing under `~/.config/unity3d/RCareWorld/RCareWorld/`

# Submit to EvalAI
Once you are done with your solutions, submit your code to EvalAI following [this](https://rcareworld.readthedocs.io/en/phy-robo-care/) tutorial. Remember, you need to sign up as a team on EvalAI before Sep 8 (11:59pm AOE) to participate.
