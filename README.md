# Here is the code for RCareWorld PhyRC Challenge ðŸ¦¾
This codebase requires a minimal installation of RCareWorld. You will have access to executables without the scenes for the competition. We will release the simulation environments for the robot-assisted dressing and bed bathing on Aug 5th AOE.

This repo is in testing stage.

# Hardware requirements
While RCareWorld supports Linux, Windows, and Mac (experimental), our evaluation platform is based on Ubuntu 20.04. We do not guarantee the simulation environments for the competition work on MacOS, Windows, or other Linux versions as intended. The executable files are by default for Linux systems. If you want to use Windows or Mac (not recommended), download it from [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TW-C6k1z5xCdgE7q1ht3Flb2FaeCrQ51?usp=sharing) and update the executable_file path.

We highly recommend using an Ubuntu 20.04 system which will be used for evaluation. Please make sure your computer has at least 10GB of free space before starting.
