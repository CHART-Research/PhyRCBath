# Here is the code for RCareWorld PhyRC Challenge ðŸ¦¾
This codebase requires a minimal installation of RCareWorld. You will have access to executables without the scenes for the competition. We will release the simulation environments for the robot-assisted dressing and bed bathing before Aug 8th AOE.

This repo is currently in the testing stage.
- Check the website https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/rcareworld/
- APIs: Please only refer to this document if you are participating in the PhyRC challenge. Please don't use the links in the main branch. https://rcareworld.readthedocs.io/en/phy-robo-care/

# Hardware requirements
While RCareWorld supports Linux, Windows, and Mac (experimental), our evaluation platform is based on Ubuntu 20.04. We do not guarantee the simulation environments for the competition work on MacOS, Windows, or other Linux versions as intended. The executable files are by default for Linux systems. If you want to use Windows or Mac (not recommended), download it from [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TW-C6k1z5xCdgE7q1ht3Flb2FaeCrQ51?usp=sharing) and update the executable_file path.

We highly recommend using an Ubuntu 20.04 system which will be used for evaluation. Please make sure your computer has at least 10GB of free space before starting.

# Download Guide
<!-- - Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld.git`
- Switch to the `phy-robo-care` branch: `cd RCareWorld` and then `git checkout phy-robo-care ` -->
Clone the `phy-robo-care` branch of the repo: `git clone -b phy-robo-care https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld.git`

# Install Guide
First of all, please ensure that conda is installed on your computer.
For details, refer to the conda installation guide: [Conda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Also, please install `libassimp`. Ubuntu users can install it with this command:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev
```
Then you can install the rcareworld!

<!-- - Create a conda environment with Python 3.10: `conda create -n rcareworld python=3.10`
- Activate the conda environment: `conda activate rcareworld`
- Install the requirements: `cd pyrcareworld` and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install pyrcareworld: `pip install -e .`
- Verify the installation works: `cd pyrcareworld/demo/examples` and run `python test_scene.py`. You should expect to see the RCareWorld Unity executable window pop up with a white cube. -->

```
# Create a conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n rcareworld python=3.10

# Activate the conda environment 
conda activate rcareworld

# Install the requirements
cd pyrcareworld
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Verify the installation works
cd pyrcareworld/demo/examples
python test_scene.py

```
 
# Get Started with the Examples
Check the examples in `pyrcareworld/pyrcareworld/demo/examples` folder. 

You can read any file in the examples folder and try running it with python to understand the corresponding output and related APIs. For more details, you can check our documentation and YouTube channel! Relevant links can be found at the bottom of this document.

You can try to run python pyrcareworld/pyrcareworld/demo/test_scene.py and then you will get a window similar to the screenshot below! This indicates that the environment is set up correctly!

# Starter Scripts for Bathing and Dressing Tasks

Check the `test_bathing.py` and `test_dressing.py` to get an overall idea about how to use the simulation environments. 

**`test_bathing.py` and `test_dressing.py` are in `Rcareworld/template`!**

Your score will be stored in a json file called `spongeScore.json` for bathing and `dressingScore.json` for dressing under `~/.config/unity3d/RCareWorld/RCareWorld/`

# Submit to EvalAI
Once you are done with your solutions, submit your code to EvalAI following [this](https://rcareworld.readthedocs.io/en/phy-robo-care/) tutorial. Remember, you need to sign up as a team on EvalAI before Sep 8 (11:59pm AOE) to participate.
